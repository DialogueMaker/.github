This is the official GitHub organization for the Dialogue Maker. This organization hosts the plugin code, official themes, and other utilities that may be helpful for developers to use with Dialogue Maker.

### Dialogue Maker Group
> [!NOTE]
> Dialogue Maker Group is looking for volunteer maintainers. Right now, the plugin depends solely on Christian Toney, who cannot contribute as regularly as he did when he first published the plugin due to scheduling conflicts.
>
> If you're interested, send a direct message to Christian_Toney on the Roblox DevForum.
